                    <p>During the Solar System formation, a mars-sized terrestrial body called Theia, collided with Earth about 4.5 billion years ago. This impact caused debris of the collision to orbit the Earth, which later on resulted in the formation of the Moon. The formation itself is theorized to have formed just within a few hours.</p>
                    <p>Usually, we use the Moon to measure months because the Moon's phases resets after every 29.5 days, which roughly equals to a month. While the Earth orbits the Sun to measure the year, the Moon orbits the Earth to measure the month.</p>
                    <p>The name of the Moon originates from the word 'mōna', it is an Old English word used in medieval times. In short, the Moon's origin name roughly translates to 'to measure month'. Of course not everybody in the world calls the Moon by same name as Old English folks did. The Moon were given other names such as 'Selene' by Greeks and 'Luna' by the Romans or other names depending on different cultures.</p>

                <h2>Facts about The Moon</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It takes approximately 3 days to travel to the Moon from Earth.</li>
                    <li>There are 8 total moon phases. They are waxing cresent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter, waning cresent, and new moon.</li>
                    <li>The moon is responsible for causing high tides and low tides due to its gravitational pull. This causes Earth's water to bulge out towards the direction of the Moon.</li>
                    <li>The first footprints made from the Apollo 11 mission, which was 56 years ago, is still there to this day.</li>
