        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <em>Kiseoung Shim</em>. I am Korean, born and raised in Cambodia. I'm the 3<sup>rd</sup> youngest among my siblings. My mother is Cambodian and my father is Korean. Which makes me Korean-Cambodian. I speak a total of 3 languages which are, Khmer, Korean, and English. I've lived in Cambodia for the majority of my life so coming to Canada is an incredible step forward in my life.</p>
        <p>I plan to study <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> here, hopefully graduate, and continue my studies in Korea. By the end of my studying journey, I hope to return back to my home country and help my family business with the knowledge and skills in order to give back to the family with gratitude.</p>
        <p>Not really a motivational quote but it helps me when it comes to self-reflection.</p>
